#reload() function 
"""
As we have already stated that, a module is loaded once regardless of the number of times it is imported into the python source file. 
However, if you want to reload the already imported module to re-execute the top-level code, python provides us the reload() function. 

The syntax to use the reload() function is given below.
reload(<module-name>)  

for example, to reload the module calculation defined in the previous example, we must use the following line of code.
reload(calculation)
